6. See success page, then log in again with new password

SECURITY FEATURES:
==================
✓ Requires current password verification
✓ New passwords must match
✓ Uses Django's set_password() for secure password hashing
✓ Login required decorator prevents unauthenticated access
✓ Validation on both client and server side
✓ Clear error messages for invalid inputs

EMAIL CONFIGURATION:
====================
Note: The existing email backend in settings.py is configured for:
- SendGrid (production on Render)
- Console backend (development)
- SMTP backend (fallback)

The current implementation does NOT send emails during password change.
If you want email confirmation before password change, you can:

1. Generate a token using Django's PasswordResetTokenGenerator
2. Send email with confirmation link
3. Validate token when user clicks link
4. Then allow password change
